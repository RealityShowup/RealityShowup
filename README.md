<h1>Konichiwa brothers </h1>
<subtext>MM-m-my noble inquiry doth dwell upon the... nature of conversations with fair... maidens from the land of the rising sun. With utmost politeness, I extend my greeting with a "konichiwa," and inquired into their favored anime, for such a pursuit is a common interest. However, my consternation doth arise from the reluctance displayed by these demure creatures, though their shyness doth hold an endearing kawaii quality, akin to a blossoming sakura. 😌

'Tis a grievous lamentation that I, as the initiator of discourse, must bear the weight of conversation unassisted... Alas, their w-w-waning interest, which I perceive stems from my status as a fair-skinned gentleman of foreign origin, doth vex my spirit. Yet, let it be known that I harbor no ill will, for the misdeeds of the past ought not to befall the blameless present... The transgressions of Pearl Harbor are not theirs to bear, nor should they be haunted by the shadow of Unit 731. 🌸
Mayhap these enchanting damsels should fathom the depths of my reverence for their cherished culture and my earnest desire to be an integral part thereof. I am prepared to embark upon a lifelong journey, wherein I wouldst pledge my troth to a Japanese lady, embrace her kin as mine own, and dwell amidst the splendors of Japan until the end of my days... Lo, I even partake in the pursuit of linguistic mastery, through the consumption of anime in its undubbed glory. Furthermore, I proudly profess my skill in the culinary arts, for I craft a delectable bowl of rice, that sustenance which is beloved by the Japanese, and thus am I akin to their kind. 🍚

Perchance, let these fair maidens of Japan recognize the sincerity of my intentions and the fervor of my devotion... For, in this tale of life, I aspire to be more than a passing stranger but a humble participant in the splendor of their culture. OwO UwU 🌟

And, in the realm of modernity, let it be known that being a Discord mod is my favorite pastime activity, one that garners admiration and, dare I say, the attentions of fair maidens. 😼</subtext>
